# 🔧 Next.js Portfolio Template / Resume Maker

> A flexible and developer-friendly portfolio template built with **Next.js**, originally based on my personal portfolio project. Intended as a foundation for a **portfolio + resume generator** or customizable portfolio product.

---

## ✨ Overview

This project started as my own personal portfolio — then I realized it could serve as a great **template** or **base** for a future resume + portfolio generator tool.

This repo will act as the **reference or starter project** for that idea.

---

## 🔨 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** (optional)
- **Framer Motion** (animations)
- **React Icons / Heroicons**
- **Vercel** (for hosting)
- **Markdown/JSON** (for structured data)

---

## 🚀 Goals (for Resume/Portfolio Builder)

The long-term idea is to evolve this into a customizable portfolio/resume generator with features like:

- 🧩 Configurable sections (via JSON or `config.ts`)
- 🎨 Theme switching (light/dark/custom)
- 📝 Resume data (work history, education, skills, etc.)
- 📄 Downloadable PDF or print view
- 📂 Multiple templates/themes
- 🌐 Easy deployment via Vercel or GitHub Pages
- 🔧 Optional CLI or GUI for non-dev users

---

## 🧪 Usage Ideas

- Clone as a starting point for personal portfolios
- Turn into a CLI tool (`npx create-resume-site`)
- Build a web interface that generates and deploys the site
- Use as a `resume.json` powered static generator
- Integrate with CMS like Notion or Contentlayer

## 💡 Potential Names

Here are a few name ideas for the final product:

| Name | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Devfolio** | Developer + Portfolio |
| **Resumix** | Resume + Remix vibe |
| **Porta** | Short for Portfolio |
| **Folium** | Latin for “leaf” (as in résumé page) |
| **Stackfolio** | Stack + Portfolio |
| **Curriculi** | From “curriculum vitae” |
| **Showcase.js** | Simple and clear |
| **Persona** | Clean, identity-based name |

> *Pick one that fits your vibe — or go abstract if you want it brandable.*
